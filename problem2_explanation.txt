-- Problem 2: Explanation (2-5 sentences) of your optimizations goes here.

By first performing the filtering on s to check only when the student is a CS major. Then, filtering on c and projecting c and e only to get the columns that we need to operate
on, we can filter the tables down to only sid and sname so that when we perform a semi join (for the EXISTS portion of the query) we will operate on as few rows as possible.
By the end we can project on sname. I believe the join reordering here boils down to separating the tables before the semi join, as there is only one actual theta join within
this query.
